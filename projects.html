            To begin with i would select the parent internship that i have done
            in my summer holidays of 2nd year where my journey of web
            development started. "Verzeo"- Here is the place where everything
            began, where i started thinking a bit more technically.I spent
            almost 2 months including the task they gave us. Our project was to
            make a website for a furniture brand that we ourself can make.It was
            really fun and i hope to counter many more of such in near future.

            Internship was now done so i thought of taking part in any kinda
            subject related exams in shrt i was looking for olympiads and as
            such anad co-incidently i found NEO-National Engineering Olympiad.
            To write this exam i had to study reasoning aptitude and science of
            course. It was really nice participating. The only barrier that i
            faced here was time due to which i couldn't attemt all questions and
            eventually i didn't clear the round. All and all it was a legitimate
            experience yet a learninng one!!

          Here is a certificate of previously mentioned course at "Verzeo" 
          You can look at it a proof!! lol !. But jokes apart i really started my 
          learning journey from here and many thing i have done that are not really certified
          but for certifications are important for proof or analyzation purpose, whatever you say!

          Now last but not the least i have the website that i have created as a project in 
          this brilliantly organized 24-day program for the first time in our college-"MJCET".
          there are many things that i have improvised that i knew already and many things i learned
          that i had a little idea about.Hopefully many more to come!!!
