        <p>
          There have ben many ups and downs in my academic career since the
          grades didn,t remain the same all the time. In short by the grace of
          god it's a positive graph

        <p>
          By God's grace i have participated in almost all the events happening
          near me and have recieved a numerous amount of certicates. Anyhow the
          funfact is that the no. isn't more but most of them are really
          valuable.

          To be honest i have been a part of many projects but i am not there
          till they end. In short i don't have patience. Although i have few of
          them in my bag that i have done in our team T-SIG.

          <p>
            If i were to be honest i don't really know what is enough!!, Anyhow
            i would say that i am talented in multiple ways. Interesting isn't
            it ?. Yepp so am i haha but jokes aside i am really lazy but i work
            smartly, Like to be precise i dont want to do any sort of Extra
            things. Although there is something that is a basic for recruitment
            ! Scope of Profit!!. Here i think i come in play. Even though i
            don't overcommit myself there is something called as commitment that
            i think have i have failed in sooo Major finding-CHECK. Now what
            have i done so far in my life ?. Here is the answer you shall find.
            These buttons below show what all projects have i done and what kind
            of knowledge do i carry. Apart from academics i love sports.
            Sounding irrelevant !. Yes it is but anyhow coming back to the topic
            i have a good command over my soft skills as well, My tech skills
            are not veryy good but these are quite praisable since i am soon
            gonna be an electronic engineer if it's in my fate and soon after
            i'll go for MS. Ahaa! hope this justifies my confidence in my
            speech. Yaa i'll acquire some knowledge and have a sound skillset
            till i reach my MS period and after MS i'll have even more skills to
            brag about so yaa that's it!!!.
